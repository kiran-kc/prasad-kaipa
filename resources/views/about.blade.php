        		<h3 align="center">Thought Provoker.</h3>
        		<p>Prasad has worn many hats in his journey spanning decades. He is an author, leadership coach, adviser,
				researcher, father and husband - in no particular order. Amidst changing roles, the only constant in his
				life has been a desire to delve deeper into his essence and sensibility.</p>
				<p>Prasad strives to bring Indian Vedantic knowledge into management theory and practice. Just like Japanese management contribution to manufacturing, he believes Indian wisdom can contribute to change management, leadership development, employee engagement and motivation in addition to general management.</p>
				<p>Artificial Intelligence is something Prasad has seen ‘grow up’ – and has been hooked on to, ever since his days at Apple University. 
				AI today is so much more than it was 20 years ago; it has the potential to give humans the emotional support 	and vulnerability shield that they so need. His current passion project is to find ways to instill compassion into Alexa, Siri, Cortana and their friends.</p>
				<p>Prasad is always on the lookout for those who share his vision and want to collaborate with him to make these dreams a reality.</p>
