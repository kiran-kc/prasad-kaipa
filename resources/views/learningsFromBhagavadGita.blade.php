					<h1>We have the body but <i>are</i> not the body. </h1>
					<h3>We have different emotions, actions or moods, but we are not those emotions, actions or moods. We are more than our body, intellect and ambition. We have something that is eternal, and can operate from there. There is ‘divinity’ within us, in the form of Atman. One Atman in all bodies --- or we are all one!
This is Prasad’s most rewarding lesson.

					<h1>Moods or Gunas are part of our nature or Prakriti.</h1>
					<h3>Each of us have different moods, or gunas. Based on our reactions to external circumstances, we have tendencies to embody 3 gunas, or states of being - dull/unenergetic (tamsik), active/ambitious (rajsik), or balanced (satvik). Once we realise that we have certain undesirable tendencies (swabhava), we can choose to not let these gunas shape our reactions - the choice lies with us.

					<h1>Surrender to the moment and be unattached to the outcome.</h1>
					<h3>Once we realise we have undesirable proclivities or moods, and that they don’t represent us, the best way to change them is practicing detachment. We can consciously choose to avoid knee-jerk reactions. Once we develop this abhyasa (practice), it is possible to develop indifference to our own proclivities.

					<h1>Multiple paths like Bhakti (Love or devotion), karma (action) and jnana (Perspective/knowledge) lead to the same end.</h1>
					<h3>We follow the path of love because we surrender to a force that is bigger than our own ego and identity. We follow a path of action because some things just ‘need to be done’.  On the path of knowledge, a bigger perspective and larger purpose helps us connect the dots and create meaning, not just understanding. Different paths lead to you taking responsibility and realising it begins and ends with you.

					<h1>Be equanimous and balanced - no matter what happens. </h1>
					<h3>The Gita teaches us moderation, equanimity and balanced perspective. Extreme measures are impractical and inappropriate. We should see beyond the polarities of good and bad, right and wrong to find peace. This lesson is easy to forget, especially in business scenarios like scaling up.

					<h1>Self control of the body, mind and emotions is the first and most important step to finding balance and peace.</h1>
					<h3>To achieve control, the Gita teaches us to establish certain set of practices and principles at 3 levels - mind, body and intellect. According to Krishna, this is important because we have to carry out our duty without being attached to outcomes. We have to give, share and contribute even if we don’t “need” to because we never know to whom we’re a role model.

					<h1>The universe operates through sharing what we have and receiving with humility (yagna or exchange).</h1>
					<h3>Yagna is an idea of doing what you’re doing without being attached to results. The Gita teaches us to never become arrogant, or take credit for what you create, or develop an ego.

					<h1>Practicing and acting without focus on the outcome helps us reach higher goals and gain support of one and all.</h1>
					<h3>Once we become detached and develop humility and gratitude, that attitude will possibly attract so much goodwill that an even larger and more positive outcome is plausible. The Gita teaches us to “Do what you can, don’t do it for the outcome”.

					<h1>Be a witness and gain perspective to whatever is happening, whether good or bad.</h1>
					<h3>After producing results, we should look at ourselves from a bird’s eye perspective - do others appreciate us only because they gained from our action? When we gain a witness perspective, we can scrutinise our contributions and those of others, and that allows us to develop appreciation for those around us.

					<h1>Find your purpose (Swadharma) and stick to it. It is better than following others however attractive that might be.</h1>
					<h3>It isn’t enough to discover our swabhava (our own nature), we must be in the pursuit of our Swadharma. We must ask ourselves - What is the purpose of my existence on this planet?  A good way to find out is serving other people and contributing to their well being. The Bhagavad Gita says when we’re living a purpose of service and contribution, we begin to discover that we’re growing and learning.
